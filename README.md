# CSC420 Project: Detect and Track Objects for Autonomous driving
#### Group members: Yuting Shao, Jijun Xiao  
## General Ideas:
Comprehensive perception of the surrounding environment is one of the most crucial tasks in autonomous driving scenario. Our goal is to detect various objects, including cars and pedestrians, as well as changes in their positions.

### Getting Started

## 1. Detect objects
We implemented SqueezeDet to detect objects and their bounding boxes described in this paper: *SqueezeDet: Unified, Small, Low Power Fully Convolutional Neural Networks for Real-Time Object Detection for Autonomous Driving* https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.01051. 

## 2. Patch matching


### Acknowledgements
We Thank Bichen Wu, Alvin Wan, Forrest Iandola, Peter H. Jin, Kurt Keutzer for providing the open-source code of their great work SqueezeDet. The original implementation is at [here](https://github.com/BichenWuUCB/squeezeDet).
